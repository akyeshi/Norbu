    This doesnâ€™t look at all like how the picture the font is completely different. There is no outline border and looks very cheap and Iâ€™m sad. Why canâ€™t you sell things that match the picture exactly thatâ€™s why people purchase it based off of pictures but thanks for ruining Valentineâ€™s Day gifts.

    Took almost a month to ship and while I understand it was the holidays the estimated shipping was way off and arrived late. Ordered a new one from a different company that arrived insanely fast and kept this one for myself. While itâ€™s pretty it scratches really easily!
